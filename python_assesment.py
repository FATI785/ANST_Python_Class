# Question 1: Basic Variable Manipulation
# #variables
name = "Alice"

# Question 2: User Input and Output
favorite_color = input("Enter your favorite color: ")

# Question 3: Simple Calculator with Conditionals
# Asking user to enter two numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

#Question 4: Even or Odd Checker
# Asking the user to enter a number
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Checking if the number is even or odd
if num % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{num} is even.")
else:

#Question 5: Age-based Category Checker
# Asking user to enter their age
user_age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Categorizing based on age
if user_age < 13:
    print("You are a child.")
elif 13 <= user_age <= 19:
    print("You are a teenager.")
else:
    print("You are an adult.")
